      Delete indices older than 45 days (based on index name), for logstash-
      prefixed indices. Ignore the error if the filter does not result in an
      actionable list of indices (ignore_empty_list) and exit cleanly.

      forceMerge syslog- prefixed indices older than 2 days (based on index
      creation_date) to 2 segments per shard.  Delay 120 seconds between each
      forceMerge operation to allow the cluster to quiesce. Skip indices that
